# StaQR

This app was designed with the goal of reducing the amount of time that USF faculty spends dealing with troublesome hardware in classrooms. It streamlines the help desk/IT personnel summoning process by utilizing QR code stickers that are placed on each device in all campus classrooms. These QR codes correspond with a database that contains information such as building number, room number, and device classification.

When a faculty member scans a QR code with the app, it automatically sends the correct information to the USF IT department, allowing them to respond and address the issue as rapidly as possible. This feature eliminates the majority of incorrect information that could be passed to the help desk by the faculty member requesting assistance. As a result, it reduces the time wasted in diagnosing a problem when the wrong information is provided or is provided too slowly.

Additionally, the app provides real-time updates on the status of the reported issue, allowing the faculty member to know when the problem has been resolved. This feature enhances communication between the faculty member and the IT department and helps to ensure that the faculty member can resume teaching as quickly as possible.
